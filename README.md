 **Trello** for organize tasks with **Agile metodology**. <br>
**Visual Studio Code** to make the code. <br>

1. check the used device (_The app works only on mobile!_) 
2. desktop page that shows a card to invite the user to switch to mobile device. <br><br>

For the mobile version i've created 3 different pages: <br>

#### Homepage
Simple homepage with a get started button.

#### Dahboard Page
Here you can find different "areas":
- _Dashboard menu_: here you can find two clickable icons (menu, and user avatar) that show user informations.
- _Search box_: here the user can search and filter doctors by name.
- _Categories slider_: here the user can find all the categories, and filter doctors by them.
- _Top Doctors_: Here you can find all the top doctors.
